# create a list of databases of interest, e.g.
ls ../*/*.db > visit_db_list.txt

# create symlinks in this directory for the dbs
# use command line arg to pass a different db list file
./gen_db_symlinks.sh

# create the ss_script.sh file for each db
# also add the relevant lines from ss_script_header.txt required to run on cuillin
./gen_ss_script.sh

# put all ss_script.sh files into a slurm script for batch submission
# the default info in slurm_header.txt assumes 1 job per core
# use command line arg to select memory per task
./gen_slurm.sh

# the resulting file test.slurm must be renamed and SBATCH details filled out:
# jobname
# ntasks
# total memory
# run time
# some of the tasks might need to be deleted to fit within the desired ntasks

# then submit the .slurm file
sbatch .slurm
